# Multi-Theme Developer Portfolio

A sophisticated developer portfolio website showcasing senior-level full-stack development, UI/UX design, and technical mastery through six distinct, fully isolated themes.

## Project Purpose

This portfolio demonstrates Fortune 500-level development skills through:
- **Six Radically Distinct Themes**: Each theme represents a different design philosophy and technical approach
- **Full-Stack Capabilities**: Backend integration, authentication, payments, and AI features
- **UI/UX Mastery**: Responsive design, accessibility, and user experience optimization
- **Enterprise-Level Code Quality**: Modular architecture, TypeScript, and maintainable patterns

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React 18** with **TypeScript** - Modern component architecture
- **Vite** - Lightning-fast build tool and development server
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling framework
- **React Router DOM** - Client-side routing and navigation

### Backend & Services
- **Supabase** - Database, authentication, and real-time features
- **Stripe** - Payment processing (demo mode)
- **OpenAI API** - AI-powered features and interactions
- **OAuth** - Social authentication integration

### Development Tools
- **ESLint** - Code quality and consistency
- **Prettier** - Automated code formatting
- **TypeScript** - Type safety and developer experience

## Architecture

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/     # Shared, theme-agnostic components
â”œâ”€â”€ pages/         # Core site pages (About, Work, Contact, Showcase)
â”œâ”€â”€ themes/        # Six isolated theme implementations
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/        # Global assets and resources
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/         # Utility functions and helpers
â””â”€â”€ context/       # Global state management
```

### Theme Isolation Philosophy

Each theme operates in complete isolation with:
- Own component library and design system
- Independent color palettes and typography
- Unique animations and interactions
- Theme-specific routing overrides
- Isolated asset management

## Planned Themes

1. **Minimalist** - Clean, typography-focused design
2. **Retro Arcade** - Vibrant, pixel-art inspired aesthetics  
3. **Storytelling** - Narrative-driven, immersive experience
4. **3D Interactive** - Three-dimensional elements and animations
5. **E-commerce** - Product showcase with shopping features
6. **Videography** - Media-rich, portfolio-style presentation
