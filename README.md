# Multi-Theme Developer Portfolio

A sophisticated developer portfolio website showcasing senior-level full-stack development, UI/UX design, and technical mastery through six distinct, fully isolated themes.

## Project Purpose

This portfolio demonstrates Fortune 500-level development skills through:
- **Six Radically Distinct Themes**: Each theme represents a different design philosophy and technical approach

```

## Core Components

### ThemeContext
Global context managing theme state with localStorage persistence:
- Theme selection and validation
- Cross-tab synchronization
- Automatic persistence

### ThemeSelector
Landing page component for theme selection:
- Accessible button grid for all six themes
- Current theme detection with options to keep or change
- Success feedback and automatic navigation

### ThemePageLoader
Dynamic component loader with lazy loading:
- Takes `pageName` prop ('About', 'Work', 'Contact', 'Showcase')
- Dynamically imports theme-specific page components
- React.Suspense integration with loading states
- Graceful error handling for missing components

### ErrorBoundary
Comprehensive error handling wrapper:
- Catches rendering errors in theme components
- User-friendly error messages with recovery options
- Development-mode error details
- Navigation back to theme selector

## Theme Isolation Philosophy

Each theme operates in complete isolation with:
- Own component library and design system (`/themes/[theme]/components/`)
- Independent page implementations (`/themes/[theme]/pages/`)
- Theme-specific assets (`/themes/[theme]/assets/`)
- Unique color palettes and typography
- Isolated routing and navigation overrides

## Available Themes

1. **Minimalist** - Clean, typography-focused design with grayscale palette
2. **Retro Arcade** - Vibrant, pixel-art inspired aesthetics with neon colors
3. **Storytelling** - Narrative-driven, immersive chapter-based experience
4. **3D Interactive** - Three-dimensional elements with depth and interactivity
5. **E-commerce** - Product showcase with shopping cart and payment integration
6. **Videography** - Media-rich, cinematic portfolio presentation

## Development Status

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## Theme Development

### Adding a New Theme
1. Create theme folder: `/src/themes/[theme-name]/`
2. Add required page components: `About.tsx`, `Work.tsx`, `Contact.tsx`, `Showcase.tsx`
3. Export theme in `/src/themes/[theme-name]/index.ts`
4. Register theme in `/src/themes/index.ts`
5. Update theme type in `/src/context/ThemeContext.tsx`

### Theme Structure
```
themes/[theme-name]/
├── pages/           # Theme-specific page implementations
├── components/      # Theme-specific reusable components
├── assets/          # Theme-specific images, fonts, etc.
├── index.ts         # Theme export configuration
└── README.md        # Theme documentation
```

## Code Quality

This project maintains enterprise-level code standards:
- Strict TypeScript configuration
- Comprehensive ESLint rules
- Automated Prettier formatting
- Modular, maintainable architecture
- Performance optimization through lazy loading
- Accessibility compliance
- Error boundary protection

## API Documentation

### ThemeContext API
```typescript
interface ThemeContextType {
  currentTheme: Theme;
  getTheme: () => Theme;
  setTheme: (theme: Theme) => void;
  resetTheme: () => void;
}
```

### Theme Types
```typescript
type Theme = 'minimalist' | 'retro-arcade' | 'storytelling' | 
             '3d-interactive' | 'ecommerce' | 'videography';
```
