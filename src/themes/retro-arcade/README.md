# Retro Arcade Theme

## Design Intent
Vibrant, pixel-art inspired aesthetics capturing the essence of 80s/90s arcade games.

## Color Palette
- Neon colors: electric blue, hot pink, lime green
- High contrast combinations
- Glowing effects and gradients

## Typography
- Pixel fonts and bitmap-style typefaces
- Bold, chunky letterforms
- Retro gaming aesthetic

## Design Constraints
- Accessibility is secondary to "arcade chaos"
- Heavy use of animations and effects
- Nostalgic gaming references
- High energy, dynamic layouts

## Components
- Pixel-art style buttons and interfaces
- Glitch effects and animations
- Gaming-inspired navigation
- Sound effects integration (future)
