- **Background**: Deep space blues and cosmic purples
- **Effects**: Neon glows, gradients, and color cycling
- **High contrast combinations** for maximum visual impact

## Typography
- **Primary**: Pixel fonts and bitmap-style typefaces
- **Secondary**: Bold, chunky letterforms
- **Effects**: Glitch effects, neon outlines
- **Style**: Retro gaming aesthetic with digital readouts
