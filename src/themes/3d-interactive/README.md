# 3D Interactive Theme

## Design Intent
Three-dimensional elements and animations creating depth and interactive experiences. This theme demonstrates mastery of modern CSS, 3D transforms, and advanced user interactions.

## Color Palette
- **Primary**: Modern tech-inspired colors (blues, silvers, whites)
- **Secondary**: Depth-aware color schemes with gradients
- **Effects**: Metallic sheens, glass effects, shadows
- **Background**: Deep space or minimal tech aesthetics
- **Accent**: Holographic and iridescent effects

## Typography
- **Primary**: Futuristic, clean sans-serif fonts
- **Effects**: 3D text extrusion and perspective
- **Style**: Spatial typography with depth
- **Hierarchy**: Z-index based visual hierarchy

## Design Constraints
- Heavy use of CSS 3D transforms and perspective
- Interactive 3D elements and hover effects
- Performance-conscious animations
- Modern browser features required (CSS Grid, transforms)
- Progressive enhancement for older browsers

## Implementation Status

### Phase 2 Complete ✅
- [x] Page stubs created (About, Work, Contact, Showcase)
- [x] Theme registration and dynamic loading
- [x] Basic component structure

### Phase 3 - To Do
- [ ] Implement 3D CSS transform system
- [ ] Create interactive 3D card layouts
- [ ] Build parallax depth effects
- [ ] Design 3D navigation components
- [ ] Add hover-based 3D interactions
- [ ] Create depth-based animations
- [ ] Implement spatial scrolling
- [ ] Add 3D model integration (Three.js)

## Components (Planned)
- 3D card layouts with transform effects
- Parallax depth scrolling
- Interactive 3D models and scenes
- Spatial navigation systems
- Depth-based loading animations
- Holographic interface elements
- 3D form components

## 3D Features
- CSS 3D transforms and perspective
- Interactive hover and click effects
- Parallax scrolling with depth layers
- 3D model integration (future)
- Spatial user interface design
- Performance-optimized animations

## Technical Notes
- CSS custom properties for 3D values
- Transform3d for hardware acceleration
- Intersection Observer for 3D triggers
- Performance monitoring for complex animations
- Fallbacks for older browsers
- WebGL integration planning
