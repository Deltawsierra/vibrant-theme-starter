# 3D Interactive Theme

Three-dimensional portfolio experience with depth and interactive elements.

## Design Philosophy
- **Spatial Design**: Content exists in 3D space
- **Interactive Elements**: Mouse/touch controls for navigation
- **Modern Aesthetics**: Dark theme with blue accents
- **Progressive Enhancement**: 2D fallback for low-end devices

## Layout Structure

### ThreeDLayout.tsx
**Purpose**: Container for 3D viewport with fixed overlay controls

**Features Implemented**:
- ✅ Fixed navigation overlay (top)
- ✅ Minimap container (bottom-right corner)
- ✅ Camera reset button (bottom-left)
- ✅ Loading animation placeholder
- ✅ Mobile/low-end device fallback context

**TODO**:
- [ ] Integrate Three.js or React Three Fiber
- [ ] Implement camera controls
- [ ] Add 3D scene management
- [ ] Build interactive object system
- [ ] Add physics simulation

### ThreeDNavigation.tsx
**Purpose**: Floating navigation that doesn't interfere with 3D interactions

**Features Implemented**:
- ✅ Fixed top overlay with transparency
- ✅ Backdrop blur effect
- ✅ Active page indicators
- ✅ 3D-themed styling

**TODO**:
- [ ] Add 3D navigation icons
- [ ] Implement spatial navigation
- [ ] Add gesture controls for mobile

## 3D Implementation Plan

### Viewport Management
```typescript
// 3D scene structure (to implement)
interface ThreeDScene {
  camera: PerspectiveCamera;
  scene: Scene;
  renderer: WebGLRenderer;
  controls: OrbitControls;
}
```

### Interactive Elements
- **Project Showcases**: 3D cards floating in space
- **Navigation**: Spatial movement between sections
- **Minimap**: Top-down view of current location
- **Camera Controls**: Mouse/touch for rotation and zoom

### Mobile Fallback
- Detect device capabilities
- Fall back to 2D card layout on low-end devices
- Maintain interactive feel without 3D overhead

## Performance Considerations
- WebGL capability detection
- LOD (Level of Detail) for complex models
- Efficient render loop management
- Memory cleanup on component unmount

## Development Dependencies (Future)
```json
{
  "@react-three/fiber": "^8.x",
  "@react-three/drei": "^9.x", 
  "three": "^0.158.x"
}
```
